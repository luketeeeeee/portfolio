The main projection for this stage is to add typing by changing the code to TypeScript (both on the frontend and backend). Another modification is related to the project's graphical interfaces, as the current screens were not designed with the purpose of being responsive. Therefore, the focus of this modification will be on adding responsiveness and fluidity to the application.",
